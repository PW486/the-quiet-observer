# Searching for the Roots of Good and Evil
###### November 30, 2025

When we see someone in need, we often feel a natural urge to help. When we witness an injustice, a flash of anger rises within us. We treat "good" and "evil" as if they are solid facts of the world, like the weather or the laws of physics. But is morality really built into the universe, or is it a social tool we created to get along?

Evolutionary psychology suggests that morality began as a survival strategy. Humans are social animals, and we could never have survived alone in the wild. To thrive, we had to cooperate, share food, and protect each other. Traits like empathy, shame, and fairness evolved because they helped the group stay together. Being "good" was simply a way to make sure the tribe survived.

From this perspective, morality might seem like nothing more than the rules of a game. If we had evolved like tigers or insects, our sense of right and wrong would be completely different. What we call a "moral compass" might just be a set of biological instincts that kept our ancestors from fighting each other.

But many people find this explanation too simple. It seems to turn love and sacrifice into cold calculations. Is there such a thing as objective moral truth? Consider how we view slavery or child labor today. We don't just think they are unpopular; we believe they are truly wrong. Some philosophers argue that as we become more conscious and rational, we discover moral truths in the same way we discover mathematical ones.

Perhaps morality started as a trick for survival, but it has grown into something much larger. Through empathy, we have learned to see the world through the eyes of others. We have expanded our circle of concern from our own families to the entire world. Morality might be our way of acknowledging a profound truth: that the lives and feelings of others are just as real as our own.
