# Our Human Obsession with Beauty

###### May 06, 2022

Human history is a long story of survival, but it is also a story of a constant and mysterious obsession with beauty. From the ancient cave paintings to the grand cathedrals, and from the simplest folk songs to the most complex symphonies, we have always devoted an immense amount of energy to things that have no immediate survival value. We decorate our tools, we tend our gardens, and we spend our lives seeking out experiences that stir our souls.

Why do we do this? From a strictly evolutionary perspective, art seems like an inefficiency—a waste of time and resources that could be spent on gathering food or building shelter. Yet, no human culture has ever existed without some form of artistic expression. This suggests that beauty is not a luxury, but a fundamental human need. It is as essential to our well-being as the air we breathe.

Art is the language we use to communicate the things that cannot be said in words. It captures the fleeting emotions, the profound questions, and the subtle textures of existence that logic and science cannot reach. When we create or appreciate beauty, we are reaching for a sense of connection with something larger than ourselves. We are expressing our wonder and our longing for order and meaning in a chaotic world.

Beauty also has a profound power to heal and to integrate. It provides a mirror for our own inner world, allowing us to see our own feelings reflected back at us with clarity and grace. A beautiful object or experience can quiet the mind, soothe the spirit, and remind us of the inherent value of life. It restores our sense of balance and provides a sanctuary from the harshness of reality.

Furthermore, our obsession with beauty is a testament to our capacity for transcendence. By creating art, we are saying that our lives are more than just a struggle for survival. We are asserting our humanity and our unique ability to find value in things that are purely aesthetic. Beauty is a bridge between the physical and the spiritual, the mundane and the eternal.

Ultimately, we create and seek beauty because it makes us whole. It nurtures our imagination and keeps our sense of wonder alive. Without art, our world would be functional, perhaps, but it would be profoundly dim. Beauty is the color and the light that make our existence meaningful. It is the evidence of our soul's desire to reach for the divine.

Learning to appreciate the beauty around us is a form of spiritual practice. It requires us to slow down and to pay attention to the subtle gifts of the present moment. By honoring the creative impulse within ourselves and others, we contribute to a world that is more vibrant and more compassionate. Beauty is not just something we see; it is something that changes us from the within.
