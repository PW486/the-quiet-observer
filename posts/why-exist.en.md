# On the Meaning of Being Here
###### January 20, 2026

It is a question that has been whispered by our ancestors under the indifferent stars and echoed in the quiet moments of our modern lives. **Why are we here?**

From a purely biological standpoint, the answer can feel a bit hollow. Richard Dawkins once described us as "survival machines," which are essentially vehicles programmed to preserve the molecules we call genes. In this view, we exist to eat, survive, and pass on the torch to the next generation. It explains the "how" of our biology, but it says very little about the "why" of our experience. If survival is all there is, it is hard to explain why we find ourselves moved by music, or why we feel a sense of awe when watching a sunset.

The philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre suggested a different path. He argued that for humans, *"existence precedes essence."* While a tool like a knife is made with a specific purpose in mind, we arrive in this world without a pre-written script. There is no divine manual or fixed destiny. This can be a frightening thought, but it is also where our true freedom begins. If the universe has not given us a purpose, then we are the ones who get to write it.

Perhaps we are simply the universe finding a way to look at itself. As Carl Sagan noted, we are made of "star stuff," and through our eyes, the cosmos finally gets to see its own beauty. We are the consciousness that gives the silent stars a name.

So, why do we exist? There might not be a single answer waiting to be found in a book. Instead, we might be here to create our own meaning through the people we love, the things we build, and the moments we choose to cherish. We are here because we are here, and in a vast and silent universe, that might just be enough.
