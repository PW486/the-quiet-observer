# Finding Peace Within Insecurity

###### March 06, 2024

We spend a vast amount of our vital energy trying to build walls of security around our lives. We seek stable careers, long-term investments, and predictable relationships, believing that if we can just eliminate uncertainty, we will finally find lasting peace. We treat the unknown as a threat to be managed or a technical problem to be solved, hoping to reach a point where nothing can surprise or hurt us.

However, the nature of life is fundamentally and beautifully insecure. Everything we hold onto—our health, our possessions, our status—is in a state of constant, inevitable flux. By resisting this reality, we create a deep sense of internal tension and anxiety. We become like people trying to hold onto a flowing river with bare hands, exhausted by the futile effort of trying to freeze something that is meant to move and evolve.

True wisdom lies in learning to be comfortable with this inherent insecurity. It is the realization that we don't need to have a fixed, unshakeable ground to stand on to be okay. When we stop fighting the transience of life, we find a different, more reliable kind of stability—one that comes from our own inner resilience and adaptability rather than from external circumstances. We learn to find our balance while moving.

Insecurity is also precisely where growth and possibility happen. If everything were certain and planned, there would be no room for new experiences, creative breakthroughs, or unexpected discoveries. By embracing the unknown, we allow ourselves to be genuinely surprised by life. We move from a defensive mindset of fear to an expansive mindset of curiosity, seeing every change not as a disaster, but as an invitation to learn and expand our boundaries.

Ultimately, finding peace in insecurity is a profound act of trust. It is the belief that we have the strength and the creativity to handle whatever comes our way, even if we don't know what it is yet. By letting go of the desperate need for absolute certainty, we open ourselves up to the full richness, mystery, and unpredictability of the human experience. We realize that the only true security is the ability to live with the lack of it.
