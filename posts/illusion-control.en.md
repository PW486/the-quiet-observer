# The Illusion of Controlling Life

###### July 31, 2024

Most of our anxiety stems from the quiet, persistent desire to control the uncontrollable. We meticulously plan our days, our careers, and our relationships, hoping that if we work hard enough and anticipate every variable, we can guarantee a specific outcome. We treat life like a complex puzzle where every piece must fit perfectly into a place we have already designated in our minds.

However, life is less like a puzzle and more like a river. It has its own rhythm, its own hidden currents, and its own depths that we can never fully map. No matter how much effort we put into building dams, the water will eventually find its own way, often carving paths we never expected. When things don't go according to our plans, we often feel like we have failed, forgetting that the most beautiful and transformative moments in life are often the ones we never saw coming.

Accepting that we are not in total control is not the same as giving up or becoming passive. It is about shifting our focus from the outcome to the process. We can control our actions, our integrity, and our perspective, but we cannot control how the world responds to us. When we stop trying to dictate the results, we become more flexible and more resilient in the face of change.

There is a strange and wonderful peace in admitting that we don't have all the answers. By embracing the unpredictability of life, we open ourselves up to a world of possibilities that our narrow plans could never have imagined. We move from a state of resistance to a state of flow, learning to work with the current rather than fighting against it.

Ultimately, the illusion of control is a heavy burden to carry. It makes us rigid and fearful of any deviation from our script. By letting go of the need for certainty, we find a sense of lightness and spontaneity. We realize that the universe is far larger and more creative than our small plans, and that sometimes, the best things happen when we simply get out of our own way.
