# The Unexpected Wisdom Within Our Regrets

###### March 01, 2022

We are often told to live with "no regrets." It sounds like a powerful and confident way to live, suggesting a path of constant forward motion and unwavering certainty. But the attempt to eliminate regret entirely can lead us to ignore the valuable lessons that our mistakes are trying to teach us. Regret is not a sign of failure; it is a sign of our capacity for growth.

We feel regret because we have become someone who knows better than the person who made the original choice. It is an indication that our moral compass has sharpened and that our understanding of the world has deepened. Without the ability to feel regret, we would be stuck in the same destructive patterns forever, unable to recognize when we have drifted from our true values.

The key is not to dwell on regret until it becomes paralysis, but to use it as a compass. It shows us exactly what we value and where we want to improve. Instead of trying to erase the past, we can acknowledge our mistakes with kindness and use that knowledge to make more conscious choices in the future. Regret is the pain of our soul trying to align itself with its higher potential.

Regret is also a bridge between the person we were and the person we are becoming. It is a humble reminder of our shared humanity and our inevitable fallibility. By listening to what our regrets are telling us, we move forward with more wisdom and a clearer sense of purpose. We find that our missteps are often the very things that pave the way for our most significant transformations.
