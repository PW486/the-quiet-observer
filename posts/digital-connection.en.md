# Finding Human Connection in a Digital Age

###### March 18, 2023

Never before have we been so technically connected, yet many of us feel more profoundly alone than ever. We spend our days sending messages, scrolling through feeds, and reacting to posts, but these interactions often leave us feeling strangely hollow. We are confusing the speed of communication with the depth of human connection, and the number of our followers with the quality of our relationships.

A true connection requires more than an exchange of data; it requires presence, vulnerability, and the willingness to truly listen. It is easy to project a perfect, curated image online, but it is much harder to be seen in our messiness, our doubts, and our uncertainty. Yet, it is precisely in those unpolished and fragile moments that real intimacy is built. We cannot truly know someone through a screen.

We need to be intentional about how we use our technology. It can be a bridge that brings us together across distances, or it can be a wall that keeps us apart from the person sitting right next to us. If we spend all our time looking down at screens, we lose the ability to read the subtle language of eyes, hands, and shared breath—the non-verbal cues that constitute the heart of human understanding.

Finding balance means choosing quality over quantity in our interactions. One deep, uninterrupted conversation over dinner is worth more than a hundred brief, distracted exchanges online. By putting down our devices and looking each other in the eye, we reclaim the human connection that is essential for our psychological well-being and the health of our souls. We find that the most important connections are the ones that happen in the silence between our words.
