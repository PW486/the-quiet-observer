# The Sustaining Joy of Stillness

###### October 12, 2022

We live in a world that is constantly moving, relentlessly making noise, and aggressively demanding our attention. We have come to believe that activity is the only measure of value and that to be still is to be unproductive, lazy, or irrelevant. We feel a strange, underlying guilt when we are not "doing" something, as if we are wasting the precious and finite minutes of our lives. We have forgotten that being is just as vital as doing.

However, there is a deep, sustaining, and quiet joy that can only be found in the deliberate practice of stillness. When we stop the constant motion of our bodies and the frantic spinning of our minds, we allow ourselves to settle into the present moment. We begin to notice the subtle details that we usually overlook—the particular quality of the afternoon light, the rhythmic sound of our own breath, the gentle hum of the world around us. In the silence, we find a sense of peace that no amount of external activity can ever provide.

Stillness is not an empty void; it is a full, vibrant, and attentive presence. It is the sacred space where our intuition can finally be heard and where our creativity can begin to flourish without the pressure of an audience. By giving ourselves permission to simply be, we recharge our internal batteries and gain a much clearer perspective on our lives. We realize that we don't need to be constantly moving to be moving forward in a meaningful direction.

Cultivating stillness requires a conscious and often radical choice to slow down. It can be found in a few minutes of quiet reflection in the early morning, a slow walk in nature without a destination, or even just a deliberate moment of deep breathing in the middle of a busy day. By honoring these necessary pauses in our lives, we find a sense of balance and groundedness that allows us to engage with the noisy world more fully and more authentically. We find that the still point is the center from which all effective action flows.
