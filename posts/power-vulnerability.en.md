# Vulnerability Is the Measure of Courage

###### December 25, 2025

We often go to great lengths to hide our weaknesses, believing that to be successful or loved, we must project an image of perfect competence and unshakable strength. We fear that if people saw our doubts, our mistakes, or our fears, they would think less of us. This constant guarding of our image creates a thick wall between us and the world, leaving us feeling profoundly isolated even when we are surrounded by a crowd.

However, true connection is only possible when we are willing to be seen as we actually are. Vulnerability is not a sign of weakness; it is, in fact, the most accurate measure of courage. It is the willingness to show up and be seen when we cannot control the outcome. When we share our struggles and our uncertainties, we give others permission to do the same, creating a shared sanctuary of honesty and empathy.

Many of our greatest breakthroughs in life—intellectual, emotional, and relational—come through the cracks in our armor. It is in the moments when we admit we don't have the answer or when we ask for help that we open ourselves up to new learning and deeper intimacy. By pretending to have it all together, we inadvertently block the very support, wisdom, and connection we need to flourish.

A strength that cannot bend is brittle and destined to break. A person who is comfortable with their own vulnerability is far more resilient than one who is constantly striving for a sterile perfection. They understand that being human involves the risk of making mistakes and feeling hurt, and they don't see these experiences as personal failures. Instead, they view them as an essential and unavoidable part of the human journey.

In the end, vulnerability is the birthplace of joy, creativity, and true belonging. It is the bridge that allows us to cross from the cold isolation of our masks to the warmth of genuine human intimacy. By embracing our imperfections and being honest about our feelings, we find a sense of freedom and relief that no polished performance could ever provide. We realize that we are most beautiful when we are most ourselves.
