# Am I Still the Same Person I Was Yesterday?
###### July 22, 2025

Imagine a famous ship that belonged to the hero Theseus. Over the years, its wooden planks start to rot, and they are replaced one by one with new ones. Eventually, every single original piece of wood has been replaced. Is it still the same ship?

If you say yes, then consider this: what if someone saved all the old, rotten planks and used them to build another ship. Now you have two ships. Which one is the "real" Ship of Theseus? This classic puzzle forces us to think about what makes us who we are.

We are a lot like that ship. Our cells are constantly dying and being replaced by new ones. The person you see in the mirror today doesn't share much of the same physical matter as the child you once were. Your brain is also constantly rewiring itself as you learn new things and lose old memories. Biologically and psychologically, you are in a state of constant change.

So, what is the thread that connects the different versions of you? Some people believe in a "soul," an unchanging part of us that stays the same throughout our lives. But that is a matter of belief. Others argue that it is our memory—the continuous story we tell ourselves about our past. But if you were to lose your memory, would you stop being yourself?

Perhaps the "self" is not a fixed thing, but a process. We are like the flame of a candle. The wax and the air are constantly changing, but the pattern of the flame remains. We aren't a finished product; we are an ongoing story.

This idea can be very liberating. If you aren't a fixed, unchanging thing, then you are always under construction. You aren't trapped by who you were yesterday. Like the Ship of Theseus, you are constantly renewing yourself, and that gives you the freedom to grow, to change your mind, and to become someone new.
