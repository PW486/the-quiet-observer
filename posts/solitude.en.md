# Finding Yourself in Solitude
###### September 20, 2025

In our hyper-connected world, being alone is often seen as a problem to be solved. We are afraid of silence. We fill every empty second—whether waiting for a bus or lying in bed—with scrolling, podcasts, or messaging. We have forgotten how to be with ourselves, and in the process, we have confused loneliness with solitude.

The theologian Paul Tillich once said that language created the word "loneliness" to express the pain of being alone, and the word "solitude" to express the glory of being alone.

Loneliness is a state of lack. It is a hunger for connection that isn't being met. You can feel lonely even when you are with other people or in a busy crowd. It is the feeling that you aren't being seen or understood. It is a cold, empty feeling.

Solitude, however, is a state of fullness. it is the joy of your own company. In solitude, you aren't isolated; you are deeply connected to yourself. It is a time for reflection and growth.

Many of history's greatest thinkers sought solitude not because they hated the world, but because they needed the quiet to understand it. In the noise of daily life, we are often just reacting—to notifications, to what people expect of us, to the latest trends. We become mirrors reflecting everyone else.

In solitude, that noise stops. We can finally hear our own inner voice, which is usually drowned out by the crowd. Solitude is the laboratory where we figure out who we really are. Without it, we risk becoming just a collection of other people's opinions.

Reclaiming solitude is an act of courage today. It means putting down the phone and sitting with your own thoughts, even the ones that are a bit uncomfortable. It means realizing that you are enough company for yourself. When you learn to be friends with yourself, you are never truly alone.
