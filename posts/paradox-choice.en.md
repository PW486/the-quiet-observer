# The Anxiety of Infinite Choice

###### October 16, 2024

In modern life, we are often told that more choice is equivalent to more freedom. We have endless options for everything from the simple clothes we wear to the complex careers we pursue. We believe that having a vast variety ensures that we will find the perfect fit for our unique needs. However, as our options increase, so does our anxiety, leading to a strange and modern form of paralysis.

When we are faced with too many choices, we often experience significant decision fatigue. The mental energy required to evaluate every alternative leaves us exhausted before we even make a move. We worry that by choosing one thing, we are irrevocably missing out on something better. This fear of making the "wrong" decision can lead to a state of indecision, where we end up making no choice at all or settling for the path of least resistance.

Even after we finally make a decision, we are often less satisfied than we would be if we had fewer options to begin with. We tend to second-guess ourselves, wondering if one of the paths we didn't take would have been more rewarding or meaningful. The presence of so many alternatives makes it easy to imagine a better outcome, which inevitably diminishes the joy and satisfaction of what we actually have in front of us.

To find peace in an age of overwhelming abundance, we must learn the art of being a "satisficer" rather than a "maximizer." A maximizer tries to find the absolute best option among all possibilities—an often impossible and exhausting task. A satisficer, on the other hand, knows their own criteria and is content once they find an option that meets those needs. They understand that "good enough" is often the key to true contentment.

Satisfaction is not about finding the perfect thing; it's about making a choice and then having the commitment to make that choice right. By limiting our focus and committing to our decisions, we reclaim the mental space that was lost to endless comparison. We realize that the quality of our lives is defined not by how many options we possess, but by how deeply and authentically we engage with the ones we choose to keep.

Ultimately, true freedom is found not in having infinite choices, but in the ability to commit to what truly matters. When we narrow our field of vision, we find a sense of clarity and purpose that a mountain of options could never provide. We learn that sometimes, limiting our choices is the only way to expand our happiness.
