# Why We Must Embrace Boredom

###### April 23, 2024

In our modern era, boredom has become something of a taboo. Whenever we have a spare moment—waiting for a bus, standing in line, or sitting through a commercial—we immediately reach for our phones to fill the gap. We are constantly consuming information, entertainment, and the curated lives of others, afraid of what might happen if we are left alone with our own unfiltered thoughts.

But boredom is not a problem to be solved; it is a vital state of being. It is the threshold of creativity and self-discovery. When we allow ourselves to be bored, we force our minds to look inward and to start exploring their own hidden corners. It is in these moments of stillness and "emptiness" that new ideas often begin to take shape and unexpected connections are made.

Constant stimulation keeps us on the shallow surface of life. It provides a sense of engagement, but prevents us from going deep. Boredom acts like a reset button for our attention. It clears the mental fog and allows us to notice the subtle things that we are usually too busy to see—the quality of our own feelings, or the hidden beauty in our surroundings.

We should learn to embrace the quiet lulls in our day. Instead of viewing boredom as a lack of activity, we can see it as an invitation to wonder. By giving ourselves permission to do nothing, we often find that we are finally able to hear the quiet voice of our own intuition. Boredom is the fertile void from which true meaning arises.
