# The Fragility of Our Objective Truth

###### November 16, 2022

We like to believe that we see the world as it truly is. We trust our senses, our logic, and our observations, thinking that they provide us with a direct and objective window into reality. We speak of "the truth" as if it were a solid object sitting in the middle of the room, waiting for everyone to see it from the same angle. But the more we understand our own minds, the more we realize that our truth is often deeply subjective.

Everything we experience is filtered through the unique lens of our own consciousness. Our biology, our past experiences, our current emotions, and our cultural background all shape the way we interpret the world around us. Two people can look at the same event and see two completely different stories. This is not because one is lying or mistaken, but because their internal filters are prioritizing different information.

Our brains are not passive recorders; they are active creators of meaning. We are constantly searching for patterns that confirm what we already believe and ignoring information that challenges our existing worldview. This "confirmation bias" is a powerful force that can lock us into a narrow version of reality, making it difficult to even consider that there might be other valid ways of seeing.

This realization can be unsettling, as it seems to undermine the very idea of a shared reality. If everyone has their own truth, how can we ever agree on anything? But acknowledging our subjectivity is not the same as denying that an objective world exists. Instead, it is an invitation to intellectual humility. It reminds us that our perspective is always incomplete and that we have much to learn from others.

True understanding comes not from insisting on our own "truth," but from the willingness to explore the multiple truths of others. By listening to different perspectives with genuine curiosity, we can build a more complex and nuanced picture of the world. We realize that reality is like a vast diamond, with a thousand facets that can only be seen when we look from many different angles.

Furthermore, seeking a more objective truth requires us to examine our own filters. We must have the courage to question our assumptions and to be honest about our biases. This self-awareness is the only way to move closer to a more integrated and accurate understanding of ourselves and our environment. It is a lifelong process of refining our vision.

Ultimately, the quest for truth is as much about the journey as the destination. By embracing the subjective nature of our experience while constantly striving for a broader perspective, we find a deeper sense of connection and empathy. We realize that while we may never see the whole "truth" in its absolute form, the act of seeking it together is what makes us truly human.
