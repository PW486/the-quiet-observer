# How Objective is Our Truth?
###### August 10, 2025

We like to think of truth as something solid and unchanging. "The sky is blue" seems like a simple, objective fact. But even this depends on how the human eye works and how light scatters through our atmosphere. To a bat, the sky isn't blue at all. To someone who is color blind, blue means something very different.

In the last century, many thinkers began to challenge the idea of a single, universal truth. They argued that "truth" is often shaped by power and culture. History is usually written by the people who won the wars. Science is filtered through the human mind and its current beliefs. From this point of view, there might not be one Big Truth, but rather many small truths that are valid within their own contexts.

This way of thinking can be liberating. it reminds us that the "universal truths" of the past were often just the opinions of a few powerful people. It gives a voice to those who have been ignored.

But there is a danger in rejecting objective truth completely. If everything is just a matter of opinion, then we have no common ground to stand on. If "the earth is round" is just one story among many, then we lose our connection to reality. If moral truth is purely subjective, how can we truly say that something like slavery is wrong? A world without a shared sense of truth can easily turn into a place where the person with the most power gets to decide what is "true."

Think of the old story about the blind men and the elephant. One man touches the trunk and thinks it's a snake. Another touches the leg and thinks it's a tree. They are all experiencing a different part of the same reality, and their descriptions don't seem to agree. But the elephant is still there.

Truth might be objective, but our access to it is always limited. We see the world through the lenses of our senses, our language, and our culture. The goal of philosophy and science isn't to claim that we have the final answer, but to compare our different maps and slowly get a better look at the whole elephant.
