# Waiting as an Active State of Being

###### September 25, 2021

We live in a world defined by the pursuit of instant gratification. We want our news now, our deliveries now, and our personal or professional success now. We have come to view waiting as a nuisance, a waste of precious time, or a frustrating sign of inefficiency. But in our frantic rush to eliminate waiting from our lives, we are losing an essential part of the human experience: the ability to exist comfortably and thoughtfully in the space between wanting and having.

Waiting is far more than just a passive gap between events; it is an active and vital state of being. It is a time for anticipation, deep reflection, and internal preparation. When we are forced to wait for something, we are given a unique opportunity to clarify our true desires and to appreciate the real value of what we are seeking. The joy of finally attaining a goal is often significantly heightened by the patience and endurance required to get there.

Learning to wait gracefully is a profound form of emotional and spiritual maturity. It requires us to manage our immediate frustrations and to find a sense of contentment in the present moment, even when our desires remain unfulfilled. By accepting the natural timing and rhythms of life, we reduce our internal stress and increase our overall resilience. We realize that most of the best, most enduring things in life—like deep wisdom, true love, and lasting mastery—simply cannot be rushed.

In the profound silence of waiting, we often hear the subtle internal and external voices that we would otherwise miss in the noise of activity. It is a time when our minds can wander freely and our creativity can begin to flourish in the fertile soil of stillness. By embracing the necessary pauses in our lives, we find that they are not empty voids, but rich environments for growth and self-discovery. The art of waiting is, ultimately, the art of trusting the slow, unfolding process of life.
