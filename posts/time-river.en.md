# Time is Not a River
###### December 18, 2025

We often talk about time as a river, a constant flow that carries us from the fixed past into an unwritten future. We remember yesterday, live in today, and wonder about tomorrow. It is a feeling so natural that we rarely question it. But modern physics tells a story that is much more strange.

According to Einstein’s theory of relativity, we should think of time not as a flow, but as a "block." In this model, space and time are joined together in a four-dimensional fabric called spacetime. Just as every city on a map exists at the same time, every moment in history exists simultaneously. The past has not disappeared, and the future is already there. New York is not "gone" just because you are in London, and in the same way, the past is not gone just because you are in the present.

Imagine a whole loaf of bread. Each thin slice is a moment of "now." You experience the slices one by one, but the entire loaf exists from the first slice to the last. This means that dinosaurs are still roaming in their specific part of the spacetime block, and our future is already a fixed coordinate on the map.

If time is a frozen block, why do we feel it moving? This remains one of the greatest mysteries of our consciousness. Many scientists believe it has to do with entropy, the universe’s tendency to move from order to disorder. Our brains record memories in the direction that entropy increases, which creates a "psychological arrow of time." We have information about the past but none about the future, and this imbalance creates the illusion of moving forward.

We are not actually traveling through time. Instead, we are a series of "observer-moments" embedded in this vast block. Every version of you, from the child to the elder, is eternally present in its own slice of time. Each one feels like they are in the "now," unaware that all the other versions are just as real and just as present in the grand architecture of the universe.
