# Why Death Makes Life Worth Living
###### October 25, 2025

Death is the only thing in life that is absolutely certain. From the moment we are born, we are on a path toward an eventual end. Yet, we live in a world that is deeply afraid of it. We hide death in hospitals and use soft words to describe it, building a civilization that often feels like one big distraction from the inevitable. We fear the end of our consciousness and the loss of the "I" that we have spent our whole lives building.

The ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus tried to offer a logical cure for this fear. He argued that we will never actually experience death. "Where I am, death is not. Where death is, I am not," he said. It is a simple but deep thought. You can experience the process of dying, but once death arrives, the "you" that could experience anything is gone.

Why should we fear a state that we will never perceive? We don't worry about the billions of years before we were born. It wasn't dark or scary or painful for us back then; it was simply nothing. Death is just a return to that same quiet non-existence. As Mark Twain once joked, he had been dead for billions of years before he was born and hadn't suffered the slightest bit of inconvenience from it.

Of course, logic alone doesn't always calm the heart. Perhaps the real answer is to see death not as a tragedy, but as the very thing that gives life its flavor. Value often comes from scarcity. Gold is valuable because it is rare, and life is precious because it is short.

Imagine a party that never ended. At first, it would be wonderful. But after a thousand years, the conversation would become tired and the joy would turn into a burden. The fact that the party has an end is exactly why we cherish the music, dance with passion, and hold onto our friends while we can.

Accepting our mortality helps us focus on what really matters. It reminds us that we are not permanent residents here, but travelers passing through. A good traveler doesn't spend their whole trip worrying about the flight home. Instead, they focus on the journey, the sights, and the people they meet along the way.
